### Why use a one-time email address?<br>
Many websites and applications these days require you to enter an email address and they can make money by selling information about you.<br>
Your email address is very valuable to internet marketers who want to send you spam emails. God knows what it is. It is also valuable for hackers. Your email address is a key piece of data that they can use when hacking your accounts. Many people use the same email address for everyone.<br>
#### ⛔️Note friends, use these emails only to create accounts that you think are not very important⛔️<br>
